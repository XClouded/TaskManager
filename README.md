TaskManager
===========

Task management for Android



Main functionality
------------------
* Sync (running internally asynchronously) and Async tasks.
* Priority management.
* Multithread management.
* Samples of use.
* Junit testing.



Description
===========
It used Java thread pool execution, future tasks and more. It is quite simple and robust,
perfect to replace Android AsyncTask when you do not need to come back to main thread.



Documentation
=============
You have the [JavaDoc](TaskManagerLib/doc/javadoc) files on doc/javadoc directory, 
and [UML](TaskManagerLib/doc/uml) diagrams on doc/uml directory.
